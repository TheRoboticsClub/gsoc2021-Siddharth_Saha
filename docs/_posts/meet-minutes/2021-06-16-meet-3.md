- Clarified some of the behaviors and errors in the navigation panel, and on giving navigation goals for the amazon warehouse exercise
- Advices
    + Look at `use_bond_` that I commented out. May be the cause of some errors
    + Engage the Nav2 forums for errors
    + Look into using a debugger like gdb or the one in CLion (has a ROS2 extension too)
    + This would allow me to set breakpoints and step over
    + Also, when it crashes, it would give a trace back
- Comment: "We re-register some nodes while starting the exercise" in robot control. This could be the root of the same node name warning. Not primary concern at the moment though.
- Waypoint navigation not working in the exercise. On giving the goal, `bt_navigator` didn't come up at all. Needs to be debugged
- ROS2 Foxy RADI on high priority
