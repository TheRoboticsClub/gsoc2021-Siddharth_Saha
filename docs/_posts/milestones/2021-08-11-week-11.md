### Progress on the Issues
#### Incorporating SLAM
- Last week's progress on Incorporating SLAM can be seen in the [Week 10 blog --- SLAM][]
- Achieved further understanding in the [Pose graph optimization][] blog

##### Erroneous map built by SLAM
*Solution*: Increased the max range of laser scanner to 15m in the urdf (`amazon_robot_description/urdf/amazon_robot_xacro_generated.urdf`) and stl (`amazon_robot_gazebo/models/amazon_robot2/model.sdf`) files

**Solved!**
