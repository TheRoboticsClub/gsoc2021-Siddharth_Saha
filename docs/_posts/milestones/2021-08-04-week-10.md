- Achieved lifelong mapping with turtlebot3!
  + Saved the SLAM posegraph using SLAM Toolbox RViz plugin
  + Closed and started another turtlebot3 world simulation
  + Input the posegraph file again into SLAM Toolbox RViz plugin
  + The robot perfectly identified its location in the older graph and resumed updating the graph
- Dissected the SLAM Toolbox' working inside the [Exploring SLAM Toolbox][] blog
