(Last week's progress on Incorporating SLAM can be seen in the [Week 9 blog][])

### Incorporating SLAM
#### Progress
- Achieved lifelong mapping with turtlebot3
  + Saved the SLAM posegraph using SLAM Toolbox RViz plugin
  + Closed and started another turtlebot3 world simulation
  + Input the posegraph file again into SLAM Toolbox RViz plugin
  + The robot perfectly identified its location in the older graph and resumed updating the graph
