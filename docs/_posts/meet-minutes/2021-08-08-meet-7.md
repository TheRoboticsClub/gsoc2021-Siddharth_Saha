Advices:

- Make the platform stick to the table
- Keep the steps to run the exercise ready in order to write the exercise description on RoboticsAcademy


#### Achieving the task
The smallest unit of the pallet delivery exercise is the pick-and-delivery of a single pallet. Repeated application of this routine will automatically achieve delivery of the remaining pallets.

Presently, two challenges in the pick-and-delivery of a single pallet:

- [x] Erroneous map being built by SLAM, possibly due to the drift problem in the bot's actuation (when given a forward velocity, the bot veers in the leftwards direction)
- [ ] After picking the pallet, the bot does not consider the pallet's size while planning trajectory to goal location
