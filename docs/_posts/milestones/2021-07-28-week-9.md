### Solving the robot_controller error

#### Error log
```
[robot_controller-13] [ERROR] [1623763205.850077317] []: Caught exception in callback for transition 10
[robot_controller-13] [ERROR] [1623763205.850086385] []: Original error: Possible typo? In the XML, you tried to remap port "goal" in node [NavigateToPose / NavigateToPose], but the manifest of this node does not contain a port with this name.
[robot_controller-13] [WARN] [1623763205.850104774] []: Error occurred while doing error handling.
[robot_controller-13] [FATAL] [1623763205.850112298] [robot_controller]: Lifecycle node robot_controller does not have error state implemented
```

#### Helpful References
- [ROS Answers: nav2_bt_navigator exception in callback](https://answers.ros.org/question/344030/nav2_bt_navigator-exception-in-callback/)
- [Behavior Tree XMLs](https://navigation.ros.org/behavior_trees/index.html)
- Examining [nav2_tree_nodes.xml in foxy-devel branch](https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2/blob/foxy-devel/nav2_behavior_tree/nav2_tree_nodes.xml). Makes it amply clear that there is no port for "goal" in NavigateToPose. This is different from [nav2_tree_nodes.xml in main branch](https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2/blob/main/nav2_behavior_tree/nav2_tree_nodes.xml)
- [ComputePathToPose XML Node](https://navigation.ros.org/configuration/packages/bt-plugins/actions/ComputePathToPose.html)

#### Solution
Added following plugin_libs to `nav2_params_with_control.yaml` (under amazon_robot_bringup):  
```xml
    - nav2_compute_path_to_pose_action_bt_node
    - nav2_follow_path_action_bt_node
```

Modifications in the BT navigator `follow_waypoints_and_load.xml` (under amazon_robot_controller):  
```xml
        <ReactiveSequence>
          <GetNextGoal goals="{goals}" goal="{goal}" goal_achieved="{goal_achieved}"/>
          <ComputePathToPose goal="{goal}" path="{path}"/>
          <FollowPath path="{path}"/>
          <LoadPallet load_queue="{load_queue}"/>
          <SetBlackboard output_key="goal_achieved" value="true"/>
        </ReactiveSequence>
```

### Incorporating SLAM
#### Need for SLAM
The pallets would be moved from original location. With a static map, we have immovable obstacles at those locations. This will impede efficiency of nav2's planning

#### Potential solution
SLAM Toolbox's [LifeLong Mapping](https://github.com/SteveMacenski/slam_toolbox#lifelong-mapping)

- Don't store as .pgm map
- Save the pose-graph
- This can be reloaded later, and the robot can continue to update that map of the world

#### Caution
This doesn't work together with AMCL localization. Need to break down all changes required in the amazon packages.

#### Progress
- For starters, check how `navigation_launch.py` under nav2_bringup and `online_async_launch.py` under slam_toolbox work together
