- Created the RViz template (Demo below). Code on my fork's branch ["issue-801"](https://github.com/trunc8/RoboticsAcademy/tree/issue-801)


### Progress on the Issues
- Please find in the [Week 4 blog][] the progress and demo for Pull Request [#1074][] (solving Issue [#5][])
- Progress on [#6][] below


#### Working on Rviz2 Template

*Added a responsive RViz button and iframe to the web-template*  
![RViz Button]({{ "/assets/img/content/week5/button-responsive.png" | absolute_url }}){:width="500px""}  
- The error message is *intentional* as no VNC server has been connected to port _6081_
- On changing the websocket port to _6080_ (external port corresponding to Gazebo), the gzclient successfully connected to the RViz frame. This is *expected behavior*.


*Connected to all 3 iframes successfully (Console + Gazebo + RViz)*  
![All 3 iframes]({{ "/assets/img/content/week5/all-three-iframes-rviz-inactive.png" | absolute_url }}){:width="500px""}  


*Spawned Gzclient from the terminal*  
![Gzclient from terminal]({{ "/assets/img/content/week5/gzclient-display-0.png" | absolute_url }}){:width="500px""}  
- Prevented the gzclient to spawn along with the `ros2 launch` command
- Executed command in terminal (visible above) and successfully attached to the Gazebo iframe from the terminal
- *DISPLAY:=0* is the xserver display to which the Gazebo iframe is attached

*Spawned cartographer in RViz from the terminal*  
![RViz from terminal]({{ "/assets/img/content/week5/all-three-iframes-rviz-display-2.png" | absolute_url }}){:width="500px""}  
- Using command `DISPLAY=:2 ros2 launch turtlebot3_cartographer cartographer.launch.py use_sim_time:=True`
- Teleoperated the bot and verified that the map was being built
- *DISPLAY:=2* is the xserver display to which the RViz iframe is attached


#### Manipulating Gazebo's gui.ini from manager.py

*100px\*100px Gazebo window*  
![100x100 Gazebo]({{ "/assets/img/content/week5/gazebo-100-100.png" | absolute_url }}){:width="500px""}  

*Corresponding gui.ini*  
![gui.ini]({{ "/assets/img/content/week5/gazebo-100-100-gui-ini.png" | absolute_url }}){:width="500px""}  
- The gui.ini contents are visible in the lower right
- These were populated programmatically from `manager-4.0.py`

#### Gazebo Quirks
![Quirk 1]({{ "/assets/img/content/week5/gazebo-quirk.png" | absolute_url }}){:width="500px""}  

![Quirk 2]({{ "/assets/img/content/week5/gazebo-quirk2.png" | absolute_url }}){:width="500px""}
