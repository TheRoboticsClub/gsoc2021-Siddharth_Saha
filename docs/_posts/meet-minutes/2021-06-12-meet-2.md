- Somewhat lengthy discussion on the two amazon exercise packages that throw errors on running `colcon build` (rviz_plugins and controller packages)
- Task: Complete debugging them
- Advice for Task: ROS2 RADI using Web Template
    + Run existing ROS1 framework and analyze what differences would be required for ROS2
    + Understand Sakshay's messages describing the web template architecture
    + Especially the idea of layers (GUI and HAL)
    + Idea for barebones task: **Place a robot in Gazebo and echo pose in terminal** 
- Abstract intuition
    + ROS2 running in the backend
    + Connections and adding functionality in the frontend
    + Intention: Someone who is unfamiliar with ROS2 should still be able to run the exercise
- Crude idea of deliverable for barebones task
    + Serve Gazebo (and Rviz, eventually) with VNC
    + Few buttons to start and stop exercise
    + Allow for code to be accepted in the web's text input
    + See if changes appear in the web template on running the code
