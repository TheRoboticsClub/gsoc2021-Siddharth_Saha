- Divide the debugging into following steps:
    + Test that Nav2 is running (by running their demos)
    + Dive into nav2's codebase
    + Try the hacky fix given in this [ROS Answer](https://answers.ros.org/question/367929/compilation-error-master-branch-navigation2/)
    + Try fixing the errors that arise after removing `bondcpp` one by one
    + Refine the question and ask it on *ROS Answers* and *Navigation2 Slack* group
- nav2 panel related to the GUI stuff (connect our waypoints with Rviz)
    ```
    QtConcurrent::run(
    std::bind(
      &nav2_lifecycle_manager::LifecycleManagerClient::startup,
      &client_loc_));
    ```
    This line adds a button
- Get a feel for nav2
- Cleared doubts on *build farm* and *node plugins*(in Behavior Trees)
