### Issues Created

- [#81][]: [foxy] amazon_robot_rviz_plugins fails to build


### Issues Solved
- [#80][]: [foxy] Fix to enable amazon_robot_controller package to successfully build; solves [#79][]
- [#82][]: [foxy] Fix to successfully build amazon_robot_rviz_plugins; solves [#81][]


### Progress on the Issues
- Please check [Week 1 blog][] for my initial deliberation on these issues
- Detailed bug reports, error logs, and discussions contained in issue pages [#79][] and [#81][]

#### Fixing #79
Two edits were performed inside *robot_controller.cpp*:

- Changed `buildTreeFromText` to `createTreeFromText`  
*Reason*: Change in API name inside the Navigation2 source code
- Commented out the `if (use_bond_)` clause inside `on_activate` and `on_deactivate` functions  
*Reason*: No matching function calls to `nav2_util::LifecycleNode::createBond()` and `destroyBond()`

#### Fixing #81
Modification in *nav2_panel.cpp*:

- Added `std::chrono::nanoseconds(-1)` as an additional std::bind argument for the functions onStartup, onShutdown, onCancel, onPause, onResume  
*Reason*: `nav2_lifecycle_manager::LifecycleManagerClient` API's have been modified to accept an additional timeout duration argument. The intended effect of `std::chrono::nanoseconds(-1)`, as per my understanding, is to never timeout.
