Out of oversight, I created Issue [#15][] which was a duplicate of issue [#10][]

In the process, I learnt about an additional GitHub feature:  
[Marking issues or pull requests as a duplicate](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/marking-issues-or-pull-requests-as-a-duplicate)



[#10]: https://github.com/TheRoboticsClub/gsoc2021-Siddharth_Saha/issues/10 "Issue #10"
[#15]: https://github.com/TheRoboticsClub/gsoc2021-Siddharth_Saha/issues/15 "Issue #15"
