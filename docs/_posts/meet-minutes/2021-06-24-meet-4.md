Two immediate tasks:

1. [ ] RViz + Nav2 Goal
2. [ ] RViz + Waypoint Follower (requires `amazon_robot_controller` package to be fixed)

Simplest task after this: Pick and place (some room for creativity here)

---

Lot of ideas about possible directions to go after completing the 2 immediate tasks like:

- Additional buttons for "Load Pallet", "Drop Pallet", "Navigate to these positions"
- Give waypoints through RViz
- Before going to multi-robot, improve the single robot:
    + Like, keepout zones (many Nav2 features to try in fact)
    + But primarily focus on this change: AMCL -> SLAM for costmaps

---

Philosophy of designing the exercise:

- The student mainly wants to focus on the algorithms
- ROS2 -> They just want to use it as a medium and shouldn't distract their focus
- Shreyas' anectode: In a course at TU Berlin, they spent 75% of the course learning ROS and 25% with the actual algorithms. We wish to solve that problem.

Thoughts on single robot exercise design:

- Objective: How fast can you complete the delivery
- The drop locations need not be adjacent
- The bot will have to make optimized decisions where to drop each pallet based on proximity and effect on remaining delivery times

---

Barebones single robot exercise in web template:

- Start with everything inside RViz
- "Start" and "Stop" buttons should interact with the exercise
- Keep the use of editor out for now
- For now, start a clock when you press "Start" button, reset when you press "Stop"

Completing the transition from the AMCL to SLAM stack might make the work a strong contender for ROSCon \'21 too

**Task**: Discuss choosing between Rviz web and VNC iframe with someone
