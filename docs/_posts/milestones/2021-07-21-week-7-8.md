**Completed!**  
It contains a few bugs related to loading the map into the planners\* and Waypoint mode Navigation.  
These bugs will be ironed out in later commits.  


\* (temporary workaround for this is pressing “Pause” and “Resume” in RViz before setting “2D Pose Estimate” as done in the video)  
<br />


#### Steps to replicate
```sh
git clone https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy.git
cd RoboticsAcademy/scripts
git checkout issue-1126
./build.sh
docker run -it \
      --rm \
      -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
      --name foxy_radi_container \
      -v $PWD/../:/RoboticsAcademy \
      -p 8000:8000 -p 2303:2303 -p 1905:1905 -p 8765:8765 -p 6080:6080 -p 6081:6081 -p 1108:1108 \
      foxy-radi ./start.sh
```
- Click the Django server URL presented
- Click the Amazon Warehouse Single Robot exercise
- Press "Connect"
- After successful connection, press the "Rviz" button followed by the "Gazebo" button
- Press the "Startup" button in RViz
- Inside RViz, press the "Pause" button, then again the "Resume" button (bug in the existing amazon warehouse exercise code, will be tackled in a different issue)
- Give "2D Pose Estimate" at the origin in RViz
- Give "Goal/Nav" destination anywhere in the map in RViz
- You should be able to see the robot navigating to the goal location in RViz as well as Gazebo
