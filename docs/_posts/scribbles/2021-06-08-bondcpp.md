### bondcpp
bondcpp[^1] is an implementation of bond in C++. It is the 'bond' process state machine library C++ implementation.

### bond
bond[^2] is a mechanism for checking when another process has terminated. A bond allows two processes, A and B, to know when the other has terminated, either cleanly or by crashing. The bond remains connected until it is either broken explicitly or until a heartbeat times out.

### Relevance in this Project
We decided to drop the `use_bond_` reference and dependency on the `bondcpp` package. The discussion of the reasons are discussed in Issue [#79][]. The final changes are indicated in PR [#80][].
