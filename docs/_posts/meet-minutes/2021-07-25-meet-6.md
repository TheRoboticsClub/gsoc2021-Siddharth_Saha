Advices:

- Choose which pallet and location to pick based on the distance
- Start thinking about documentation
- Keep in mind Aug 16-23 Final eval. 3 weekends left. Plan accordingly
- Whenever stuck with an error, start documentation
- Add new exercise in RoboticsAcademy docs

We can prioritize upcoming tasks like this:

1. [ ] Include timer in the RADI
2. [x] Make the pallets aligned in CustomRobots
3. [x] Check: Do we have SLAM readily available? *Update: Yes*
4. [ ] Incorporate SLAM
5. [ ] Construct a data structure to store destination and source locations, state of the robot
6. EITHER  
  
    - [ ] Go for RViz solution  
  
    OR  

    - [ ] Code the function that performs the delivery (can be replaced by the student's algo in text editor later) &  
    - [ ] Establish text editor connections with the RADI
