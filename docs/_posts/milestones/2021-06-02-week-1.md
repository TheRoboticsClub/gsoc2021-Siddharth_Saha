### Packages explored
- [Custom Robot's amazon_robot](https://github.com/JdeRobot/CustomRobots/tree/foxy-devel/amazon_robot) - Commands and Error described in Issue [#4][]
- From Shreyas' [Week 9 Blog(Finding the way)](https://theroboticsclub.github.io/colab-gsoc2020-Shreyas_Gokhale/finding-the-way), inside my ROS2 Foxy Docker environment (accessed using `./start_rd2.sh`) all of these in the same terminal -
```
cd ~/colcon_ws/src/
git clone -b foxy-devel https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2.git
cd navigation2 
source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.sh
colcon build
. ./install/setup.sh
export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle
```
```
cd ~/colcon_ws/src/
git clone -b foxy-devel git@github.com:JdeRobot/CustomRobots.git
cd ../CustomRobots/amazon_robot
colcon build
. ./install/setup.sh
```
```
cd ~/shared-directory/
git clone https://github.com/TheRoboticsClub/colab-gsoc2020-Shreyas_Gokhale.git
cd colab-gsoc2020-Shreyas_Gokhale/exercises/ros2/amazon_warehouse/launch
ros2 launch amazon_warehouse_world.py
```
Errors in *CustomRobots/amazon_robot*:
    + **amazon_robot_controller** fails - unable to find `bondcpp` (solved)
    + **amazon_robot_rviz_plugins** fails - error: static assertion failed: Wrong number of arguments for pointer-to-member (solved)
    + Ignored those 2 packages for the time being using `COLCON_IGNORE`.  
<br/>  
  
  Dealing with these errors:  
    + Fixed `bondcpp` problem by cloning and building `bond_core` from source. Steps mentioned in this [ROS Answer](https://answers.ros.org/question/367929/compilation-error-master-branch-navigation2/)
    + *amazon_robot_controller* compiles successfully, though I suspect simply removing bondcpp as a dependency won't make any difference.
    + *amazon_robot_rviz_plugins* error stands. Apparently incorrect of arguments given to `std::bind`. Understanding this method and the error from this [StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29609866/stdbind-makes-no-sense-to-me-whatsoever)  
    + Commented all lines of code containing `std::bind` in *nav2_panel.cpp* of *amazon_robot_rviz_plugins* package (Functions *onStartup*, *onShutdown*, *onCancel*, *onPause*, *onResume*). Package compiled after that.
    + **Solved it!** Added `std::chrono::nanoseconds(-1)` to the arguments of std::bind. It's the value of default argument in *lifecycle_manager_client.cpp* of *nav2_lifecycle_manager* package. Not sure why "_Arity" still had a problem with it
    + *Comment:* [Suggested on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52328037/stdbind-cant-get-method-with-single-parameter-to-work) that lambda functions have replaced `std::bind`. Might consider this.  
<br/>  

  Error: *File or path does not exist* (solved)
    + Fix: In `~/shared-directory/colab-gsoc2020-Shreyas_Gokhale/exercises/ros2/amazon_warehouse/launch/amazon_warehouse_world.py`
    + Line 153: Replace `amazon_robot.model` with `amazon_warehouse.model` or `amazon_warehouse_with_robot.model`  
<br/>  

  Error: *Fixed frame [map] does not exist*
    + No fix yet
