### Advices
- For collab repo, create branch with issue-name and merge solution using PRs
- Use the Kanban board in GitHub to keep track of To-do's and issues
- Update blog at least once a week
- Try to publish blogs well in advance of the meetings so that mentors can skim through the work
- Maintain a milestone table and try to include YouTube links of work
- Pick between ROS2 Foxy and Galactic
  + Galactic is not LTS; Proceed with Foxy
- Be prepared to tackle issues in standard repositories (like Turtlebot, nav2, etc)
- Decide architecture at the start
- Testing
  + Bare minimum: Make sure that my work performs correctly on another machine
  + Ask others to beta-test. Every time that I publish something new, post it on Slack
- Order of help: Self > Forums > Mentors > Bigger community
- Create a mini self-contained version of code causing an error before approaching the bigger community for help (They don't want to go through all my code)
- Licenses in the name of JdeRobot
- Update key points in blog after every meeting
- On running across a nice article, put it as a reference in the blog



### Tasks
- [x] Write initial issues on GitHub Kanban's ToDo board
- [x] Get Shreyas' setup running; Fix any errors along the way
